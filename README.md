# Responsive Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution for the [Recipe Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge involves creating a fully responsive recipe page based on a provided design. The goal was to replicate the layout and functionality as closely as possible using modern web development practices.
